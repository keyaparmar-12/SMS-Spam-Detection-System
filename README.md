Spam Classification
This repository contains a spam classification project using various machine learning algorithms. The project processes and classifies SMS messages into "ham" (not spam) and "spam" categories.

Project Overview
Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned by dropping irrelevant columns, renaming columns, and handling missing or duplicate values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analysis includes visualization of data distributions and statistical summaries of message characteristics.
Text Preprocessing: Text data is transformed through lowercase conversion, tokenization, punctuation removal, stop words removal, and stemming.
Feature Extraction: Features are extracted using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer.
Model Building: Various classifiers including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and others are trained and evaluated.
Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on accuracy and precision, and performance metrics are compared.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, sklearn, wordcloud
Machine Learning: Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extra Trees
